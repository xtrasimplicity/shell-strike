A simple ruby gem to automatically identify valid SSH credentials for a server using custom username and password dictionaries, and (optionally) perform actions against hosts using the identified credentials.


This gem is intended to be used for educational purposes, and was written to assist with quickly identifying credential combinations for poorly documented internal servers. This gem is intended to be used against servers that you are authorised to 'attack' and the developer takes no responsibility for any issues which may arise due to misuse of this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shell_strike'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shell_strike

## Usage
Create a new instance of ShellStrike, passing in an array of ShellStrike::Host objects, an array of usernames and an array of passwords. i.e.

```
hosts = [
  ShellStrike::Host.new('192.168.1.100'),
  ShellStrike::Host.new('192.168.1.101')
]

usernames = ['admin', 'root']
passwords = ['password', 'letmein']

shell_strike = ShellStrike.new(hosts, usernames, passwords)

shell_strike.perform_attack
```

## TODO
- Add support for user-defineable SSH arguments such as KexAlgorithms and key-based auth.
- Add support for interactive SSH sessions.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
